## About
ModuleLIFT was 1st created back in 2018 as a proof of concept for a new type of pugging system. Recently I've decided to open source the project in hope to get support from other developers in the communitity.

The idea behind ModuleLIFT is to create a powerful API for creating & monitoring PUGs.
