#### This project is NOT considered production ready.

### Development Status
Currently I'm improving some of the libraries this project uses, then I'll be implementing more discord functionality & cleaning up the API responses. Afterwards development on the graphql routes will start & we'll see some detailed examples on how to use this API.

## Contributions
Before contributing make sure to do the following:
- Read [this documentation](/docs/modules.md), developing an idea for the internal design is important to limit security concerns, limit repetitive code & to keep a consistent design.
- Read [our testing documentation](/tests).
- Look over the [Starlette documentation](https://www.starlette.io/).
- Have a peek at the [Databases documentation](https://github.com/encode/databases).
- Understand awaiting code.

### Code Style
- [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with 80 character line limits.
- [Cornflakes linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kevinglasson.cornflakes-linter) is an helpful VS Code extension for PEP8.
